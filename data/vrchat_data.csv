Aight. There seems to be some severe confusion here from some folks.

I am not a 3d modeller, I am not an artist or 3d artist. I am notably poor at art in general.

This is a hobby I do to enjoy myself and learn new things. I am NOT attempting to make money off of this. I am NOT attempting to make this a career. I've been using VRChat since 2017, and I've been making avatars and worlds for it since 2020, with a very slowly increasing level of skill. The vast majority of what has been mentioned I am intimately familiar with. What I am not, is taught, or an expert, or a professional 3d artist. 

I am looking for tutorials on best practices for optimization so that when I make future avatars and worlds I have some resources I can reference to make sure my *HOBBY* of making shit for VR doesn't make other people's experience worse.

I am not asking for lessons on how to make an avatar, the documentation does that fine. I'm not looking for advice on 3d modelling schools to go to, I'm complaining about one *very specific* kind of person here, and presenting an option for them to be something other than a net drain on the community.

There's a lot of decent advice here if you want to become a 3d artist, sadly the latest few comments are all professionals who seem to lack the understanding that not everyone wishes to dedicate their lives to their hobby. 

I'll be compiling all the links to relevant tutorials, videos, etc. without any sort of organization until I go through them all over the next few days.

The thing is there isn't one method for optimization. You must learn and adapt methods in order to meet your needs.

However a Good rated avatar *is* optimized. If they're yelling at you because you decide to use one 4k texture or something, tell them to stuff it.)

-_-_

I've provided a few links but I'll start by saying there is no ""one"" good way to do it, which is why the tutorials contradict one another. 

This one is an hour an a half but it's very nice and very clear, you may not directly learn the skill, but the concepts are pretty interesting: [Warcraft Topology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiYEO49B768)

This is a tutorial is about Retopology which is the process of essentially tracing your model in 3d, to create a much cleaner topology for your model: [Retopo](https://youtu.be/X2GNyEUvpD4)

For someone who just wants to kinda just do it and learn it in a quick way: [This Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCdhkLUCV8A) would be best.

Essentially just download good references, understand why they're good and then replicate them. It takes practice but it's a skill like any other.

Also download PureRef for references it's a cool little program that you can add a bunch of images to reference, very useful.

Also just some general examples of topology: [Pintrest Examples](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/search/pins/?q=optimal%20topology&amp;rs=typed)

-_-_

I didn't watched that video (I create worlds, I'm not too much into avatar creation), but I was told that it is an excellent video to learn how to optimize avatars : It was made by Tupper [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBQeNON64Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBQeNON64Q)

For worlds, I published last year this Udon optimization tip world, but it mostly just applies to Udon [https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld\_174475ad-6f8e-444d-8b02-67cd13e13b74](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_174475ad-6f8e-444d-8b02-67cd13e13b74)

-_-_

Three thoughts:

1) Compared to most users of these tools in real-time applications (Making a game vs movie), one thing lacking from VRChat users is going to be performance standards. A game would probably avoid having one goblin have 5x the polygons as the others.

2) yesterday I went searching for a video on removing vertex colors, instead found a video where someone is using them instead of a texture. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUdYf_4UBcg

Most of the Quest shaders use the vertex colors, so this sometimes causes black models, or [weirdly colored model](https://www.reddit.com/r/VRchat/comments/t7umzm/when_i_change_from_standard_to_standard_lite_this/)

3) I have an optimized avatar that I made by deciding to remove clothing toggles, and just deleting anything unused. Going to keep those boots on all the time, you can delete the legs a bit below the boot on this copy. When I was in the process of doing it, I had an avatar missing pieces when I used the toggles. Fun for scaring people :D, well and also showing what I was talking about.

-_-_

I was on Twitter the other day and someone posted a whole written guide on how they optimise their model! I don't make models (yet) so this was saved as a ""just in case"" for me.

[Tutorial here!](https://gummidot.notion.site/gummidot/how-I-optimize-VRChat-avatars-c656a2b3ffd24fba9245ff74da7b690a#cf9f9af50c654107b032db75b8906e85)

-_-_

[Skin Modifier](https://youtu.be/nWHPh08KVBo?si=IU0Qdm8BA0A6XZv5) is a great way to get a base shape going to sculpt from if you're doing something from scratch!

[Joining objects](https://youtu.be/bxelGdpMx-w?si=1yFC4KA0fy5R-i3y) will reduce your number of skinned meshes.  Don't use this for clothes that aren't meant to be a single outfit though, as if your clothing items are each a separate mesh, you can toggle them off completely in Unity for when you're not wearing something.

[UV mapping](https://youtu.be/XleO7DBm1Us?si=iWgM9fgD0SxSZxev) for non distorted texturing.  Changing these on a model with existing textures will break the textures, so only use this if you plan to make your own textures.

I couldn't find any great tutorials on it, but reducing your material slots is another good one.  Ideally you would have one material for each skinned mesh on your object.  In edit mode in blender, you can select which vertices you want to be one material.  Then go to that material in the menu on the right, and hit assign.  Every selected vertex will be assigned that material.  Then in substance painter or whatever you use during texturing, you can use paint layers and the metal and rough sliders for that layer to decide which parts are glossy and which are rough, or metallic and non metallic.

[Weight Painting](https://youtu.be/4fICQmBEt4Y?si=MXhokRJajc7c0pFb) is important for anyone who wants to reduce their bone and PhysBone counts (I'm looking at you, cape and dress assets with 100 physbones).  If have a good level of overlap in the weights of two bones at a joint, you don't need very many bones to have a smooth flowy looking cloth  when in motion.  Even though an angle between the bones may be pretty sharp, a good weight paint will mean the mesh still curves smoothly.

This is all Blender stuff, but the majority of your optimizations have to start from Blender.

###ORIGINAL POST

You'd think that for all the ""experts"" on this subreddit squealing like stuck pigs over ""edge loops"" and other poorly named optimizations, they would have resources or tutorials to reference and share around that actually help people newer to 3d modelling optimize their avatars properly.

I personally ascribe to the philosophy that if you don't have a solution or aren't looking for a solution, don't complain about it. I have some solutions and I'm looking for others.

So to the squealing optimizers out there;
#IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO OPTIMIZE PROPERLY SHOW THEM HOW, IF YOU CANNOT DUMB IT DOWN ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN IT CLEARLY TO A FIVE YEAR OLD, YOU CLEARLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND NEARLY AS MUCH AS YOU CLAIM.

So prove it. Make a tutorial that lays out EXACTLY how to use standard open source tools like blender to optimize a 3d model for import into VRChat to be used as an avatar.

If they don't want to make videos, guess what? Tutorials were written down for a long time before there was YouTube, and it's more efficient and useful for people to be able to scroll through a text document with picture examples to find what they need than go hunting through a video series.

This is something that has been exceedingly annoying about VRC, and after thousands of hours and hundreds of personal projects related to it I still get people screaming about how my good rated avatars are unoptimized. Fine, prove it by showing people how to do it properly, or shut up.",0.73,"For all the screaming about optimization...###EDIT

I didn't watched that video (I create worlds, I'm not too much into avatar creation), but I was told that it is an excellent video to learn how to optimize avatars : It was made by Tupper [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBQeNON64Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFBQeNON64Q)

For worlds, I published last year this Udon optimization tip world, but it mostly just applies to Udon [https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld\_174475ad-6f8e-444d-8b02-67cd13e13b74](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_174475ad-6f8e-444d-8b02-67cd13e13b74)

Three thoughts:

1) Compared to most users of these tools in real-time applications (Making a game vs movie), one thing lacking from VRChat users is going to be performance standards. A game would probably avoid having one goblin have 5x the polygons as the others.

2) yesterday I went searching for a video on removing vertex colors, instead found a video where someone is using them instead of a texture. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUdYf_4UBcg

Most of the Quest shaders use the vertex colors, so this sometimes causes black models, or [weirdly colored model](https://www.reddit.com/r/VRchat/comments/t7umzm/when_i_change_from_standard_to_standard_lite_this/)

3) I have an optimized avatar that I made by deciding to remove clothing toggles, and just deleting anything unused. Going to keep those boots on all the time, you can delete the legs a bit below the boot on this copy. When I was in the process of doing it, I had an avatar missing pieces when I used the toggles. Fun for scaring people :D, well and also showing what I was talking about.

-_-_

I was on Twitter the other day and someone posted a whole written guide on how they optimise their model! I don't make models (yet) so this was saved as a ""just in case"" for me.

[Tutorial here!](https://gummidot.notion.site/gummidot/how-I-optimize-VRChat-avatars-c656a2b3ffd24fba9245ff74da7b690a#cf9f9af50c654107b032db75b8906e85)

[Skin Modifier](https://youtu.be/nWHPh08KVBo?si=IU0Qdm8BA0A6XZv5) is a great way to get a base shape going to sculpt from if you're doing something from scratch!

[Joining objects](https://youtu.be/bxelGdpMx-w?si=1yFC4KA0fy5R-i3y) will reduce your number of skinned meshes.  Don't use this for clothes that aren't meant to be a single outfit though, as if your clothing items are each a separate mesh, you can toggle them off completely in Unity for when you're not wearing something.

[UV mapping](https://youtu.be/XleO7DBm1Us?si=iWgM9fgD0SxSZxev) for non distorted texturing.  Changing these on a model with existing textures will break the textures, so only use this if you plan to make your own textures.

I couldn't find any great tutorials on it, but reducing your material slots is another good one.  Ideally you would have one material for each skinned mesh on your object.  In edit mode in blender, you can select which vertices you want to be one material.  Then go to that material in the menu on the right, and hit assign.  Every selected vertex will be assigned that material.  Then in substance painter or whatever you use during texturing, you can use paint layers and the metal and rough sliders for that layer to decide which parts are glossy and which are rough, or metallic and non metallic.

[Weight Painting](https://youtu.be/4fICQmBEt4Y?si=MXhokRJajc7c0pFb) is important for anyone who wants to reduce their bone and PhysBone counts (I'm looking at you, cape and dress assets with 100 physbones).  If have a good level of overlap in the weights of two bones at a joint, you don't need very many bones to have a smooth flowy looking cloth  when in motion.  Even though an angle between the bones may be pretty sharp, a good weight paint will mean the mesh still curves smoothly.

This is all Blender stuff, but the majority of your optimizations have to start from Blender.

###ORIGINAL POST

You'd think that for all the ""experts"" on this subreddit squealing like stuck pigs over ""edge loops"" and other poorly named optimizations, they would have resources or tutorials to reference and share around that actually help people newer to 3d modelling optimize their avatars properly.

I personally ascribe to the philosophy that if you don't have a solution or aren't looking for a solution, don't complain about it. I have some solutions and I'm looking for others.

So to the squealing optimizers out there;
#IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO OPTIMIZE PROPERLY SHOW THEM HOW, IF YOU CANNOT DUMB IT DOWN ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN IT CLEARLY TO A FIVE YEAR OLD, YOU CLEARLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND NEARLY AS MUCH AS YOU CLAIM.

So prove it. Make a tutorial that lays out EXACTLY how to use standard open source tools like blender to optimize a 3d model for import into VRChat to be used as an avatar.

If they don't want to make videos, guess what? Tutorials were written down for a long time before there was YouTube, and it's more efficient and useful for people to be able to scroll through a text document with picture examples to find what they need than go hunting through a video series.

This is something that has been exceedingly annoying about VRC, and after thousands of hours and hundreds of personal projects related to it I still get people screaming about how my good rated avatars are unoptimized. Fine, prove it by showing people how to do it properly, or shut up."

VRchat,People in VRChat are impossible to interact with,"No, this isn't your typical ""I'm not sure how to interact with people"" kind of post. While I am a bit nervous about that, I'm decently social and I manage it just fine. This is about the problem with the players who are already in this game.

Me and my friend, both new to the game, decided to hop on to see if we could find some funny weird people or even just someone to chill with. We world hopped together for legitimately about 2-3 hours straight trying to talk to multiple people in big groups, small groups, and by themselves. Out of all of these dozens of people we tried to interact with, we were never acknowledged whatsoever. One dude had an avatar where you could ride in his little frog car but then got mad at me for doing it (why have it on then?) but still completely ignored every single thing me and my friend were saying. He kept telling me off as we were trying to joke around being completely ignored until I just gave up. We couldn't even TRY to make friends because it was like we genuinely didn't exist to these people.

At the time of posting now, we did ANOTHER 2-3 hour session and had basically the exact same experience. Through both of these sessions together, we've had a grand total of maybe 2 or 3 interactions with only one lasting beyond a couple minutes after dozens of attempts.

I assume it might be because we're visitors and people just have them auto blocked or something, but when it's to this degree it's kind of ridiculous. Isn't this a social game? Why is it impossible to find people actually being social? I understand I'm super new so maybe I'm missing something here; if I am, feel free to let me know. Did we just get extremely unlucky or is this normal?


Edit: Thanks for the advice everyone! We had another session where we played some Murder 4 and it went extremely well, we met multiple chill people we talked to the whole time on just the second lobby we tried. Despite what some people are saying, me and my friend do not have personality issues (lmao), it looks like we really were just getting insanely unlucky.

If it's in Unity, then VRM Importer has changed so much that none of the options are there as presented anymore and you can't follow any of the steps. Or the tutorial is for a .unitypackage or .fbx and just assumes it works the same way for VRMs, when it doesn't, because the VRM Importer works very differently from what it apparently was a while back. 

If it's in Blender, it's either that CATS, VRM Addon, and Blender don't have compatible versions to download. Some require newer Blender then others, and the other requires an older where the newer one doesn't work anymore. If you somehow get things to work inside one version, all of the addons have updated since the tutorials has been made and either the options are not there anymore, or they do something different, or then the starting point is totally different from the tutorials.
